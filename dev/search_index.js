Consequently, the first expression in the pipeline must be a nullary function. If you use a symbol like rand, it will be interpreted as a function and called normally. If you use any other expression, it will be interpreted as the body of a nullary function. For example in @b rand(10) the function being benchmarked is () -> rand(10).\n\nLater positions in the pipeline must be unary functions. As with the first function, you may provide either a function, or an expression. However, the rules are slightly different. If the expression you provide contains an _ as an rvalue (which would otherwise error), it is interpreted as a unary function and any such occurrences of _ are replaced with result from the previous function in the pipeline. For example, in @b rand(10) sort(_, rev=true) the setup function is () -> rand(10) and the primary function is x -> sort(x, rev=true). If the expression you provide does not contain an _ as an rvalue, it is assumed to produce a function and is called with the result from the previous function in the pipeline. For example, in @b rand(10) sort!∘shuffle!, the primary function is simply sort!∘shuffle! and receives no preprocessing. @macroexpand can help elucidate what is going on in specific cases.\n\nPositional argument disambiguation\n\nsetup, teardown, and init are optional and are parsed with that precedence giving these possible forms:\n\n@b f\n@b setup f\n@b setup f teardown\n@b init setup f teardown\n\nYou may use an underscore _ to provide other combinations of arguments. For example, you may provide a teardown and no setup with\n\n@b _ f teardown\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nProvide keyword arguments using name=value syntax similar to how you provide keyword arguments to ordinary functions. Keyword arguments to control executions are\n\nevals::Integer How many function evaluations to perform in each sample. Defaults to automatic calibration.\nsamples::Integer Maximum number of samples to take. Defaults to unlimited and cannot be specified without also specifying evals. Specifying samples = 0 will cause @b to run the warmup sample only and return that sample.\nseconds::Real Maximum amount of time to spend benchmarking. Defaults to 0.1 seconds unless samples is specified in which case it defaults to 1 second. Set to Inf to disable the time limit. Compile time is typically not counted against this limit. A reasonable effort is made to respect the time limit, but it is always exceeded by a small about (less than 1%) and can be significantly exceeded when benchmarking long running functions.\n\nEvaluation model\n\nAt a high level, the implementation of this function looks like this\n\nx = init()\nresults = []\nfor sample in 1:samples\n    y = setup(x)\n\n    t0 = time()\n\n    z = f(y)\n    for _ in 2:evals\n        f(y)\n    end\n\n    push!(results, time()-t0)\n\n    teardown(z)\n\nend\n\nSo init will be called once, setup and teardown will be called once per sample, and f will be called evals times per sample.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> @b rand(10000) # Benchmark a function\n5.833 μs (2 allocs: 78.172 KiB)\n\njulia> @b rand hash # How long does it take to hash a random Float64?\n1.757 ns\n\njulia> @b rand(1000) sort issorted(_) || error() # Simultaneously benchmark and test\n11.291 μs (3 allocs: 18.062 KiB)\n\njulia> @b rand(1000) sort! issorted(_) || error() # BAD!
