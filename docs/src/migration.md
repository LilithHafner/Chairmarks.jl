# [How to migrate from BenchmarkTools to Chairmarks](@id migration)

Chairmarks has a similar samples/evals model to BenchmarkTools. It preserves the keyword
arguments `samples`, `evals`, and `seconds`. Unlike BenchmarkTools, the `seconds` argument
is honored even as it drops down to the order of 30μs (`@b @b hash(rand()) seconds=.00003`).
While accuracy does decay as the total number of evaluations and samples decreases, it
remains quite reasonable (e.g. I see a noise of about 30% when benchmarking
`@b hash(rand()) seconds=.00003`). This makes it much more reasonable to perform
meta-analysis such as computing the time it takes to hash a thousand different lengthed
arrays with `[@b hash(rand(n)) seconds=.001 for n in 1:1000]`.

Both BenchmarkTools and Chairmarks use an evaluation model structured like this:

```julia
init()
samples = []
for _ in 1:samples
    setup()
    t0 = time()
    for _ in 1:evals
        f()
    end
    t1 = time()
    push!(samples, t1 - t0)
    teardown()
end
return samples
```

In BenchmarkTools, you specify `f` and `setup` with the invocation
`@benchmark f setup=(setup)`. In Chairmarks, you specify `f` and `setup` with the invocation
`@be setup f`. In BenchmarkTools, `setup` and `f` communicate via shared local variables in
code generated by BenchmarkTools. In Chairmarks, the function `f` is passed the return
value of the function `setup` as an argument. Chairmarks also lets you specify `teardown`,
which is not possible with BenchmarkTools, and an `init` which can be emulated with
interpolation using BenchmarkTools.

Here are some examples of corresponding invocations in BenchmarkTools and Chairmarks:

| BenchmarkTools    | Chairmarks |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `@btime rand();`  | `@b rand()` |
| `@btime sort!(x) setup=(x=rand(100)) evals=1;` | `@b rand(100) sort! evals=1` |
| `@btime sort!(x, rev=true) setup=(x=rand(100)) evals=1;` | `@b rand(100) sort!(_, rev=true) evals=1` |
| `@btime issorted(sort!(x)) \|\| error() setup=(x=rand(100)) evals=1` | `@b rand(100) sort! issorted(_) \|\| error() evals=1` |
| `let X = rand(100); @btime issorted(sort!($X)) \|\| error() setup=(rand!($X)) evals=1 end` | `@b rand(100) rand! sort! issorted(_) \|\| error() evals=1` |

For automated regression tests, [RegressionTests.jl](https://github.com/LilithHafner/RegressionTests.jl)
is a work in progress replacement for the `BenchmarkGroup` and `@benchmarkable` system.
Because Chairmarks is efficiently and stably autotuned and RegressionTests.jl is inherently
robust to noise, there is no need for parameter caching.

### Toplevel API

Chairmarks always returns the benchmark result, while BenchmarkTools mirrors the more
diverse base API.

| BenchmarkTools          | Chairmarks         | Base           |
|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| `minimum(@benchmark _)` | `@b`               | N/A            |
| `@benchmark`            | `@be`              | N/A            |
| `@belapsed`             | `(@b _).time`      | `@elapsed`     |
| `@btime`                | `display(@b _); _` | `@time`        |
| N/A                     | `(@b _).allocs`    | `@allocations` |
| `@ballocated`           | `(@b _).bytes`     | `@allocated`   |

Chairmarks may provide `@belapsed`, `@btime`, `@ballocated`, and `@ballocations` in the
future.

### Fields

Benchmark results have the following fields:

| Chairmarks             | BenchmarkTools      | Description            |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| `x.time`               | `x.time*1e9`        | Runtime in seconds     |
| `x.time/1e9`           | `x.time`            | Runtime in nanoseconds |
| `x.allocs`             | `x.allocs`          | Number of allocations  |
| `x.bytes`              | `x.memory`          | Number of bytes allocated across all allocations |
| `x.gc_fraction`        | `x.gctime / x.time` | Fraction of time spent in garbage collection |
| `x.gc_time*x.time`     | `x.gctime`          | Time spent in garbage collection |
| `x.compile_fraction`   | N/A                 | Fraction of time spent compiling |
| `x.recompile_fraction` | N/A                 | Fraction of time spent compiling which was on recompilation |
| `x.warmup`             | `true`              | whether or not the sample had a warmup run before it |
| `x.evals`              | `x.params.evals`    | the number of evaluations in the sample |

Note that more fields may be added as more information becomes available.

### Nonconstant globals and interpolation

Like BenchmarkTools, benchmarks that include access to nonconstant globals will receive a
performance overhead for that access and you can avoid this via interpolation.

However, Chairmarks's arguments are functions evaluated in the scope of the macro call, not
quoted expressions `eval`ed at global scope. This makes nonconstant global access much less
of an issue in Chairmarks than BenchmarkTools which, in turn, eliminates much of the need to
interpolate variables. For example, the following invocations are all equally fast:

```jldoctest
julia> x = 6 # nonconstant global
6

julia> f(len) = @b rand(len) # put the `@b` call in a function (highest performance for repeated benchmarks)
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(x)
15.318 ns (2 allocs: 112 bytes)

julia> @b rand($x) # interpolate (most familiar to BenchmarkTools users)
15.620 ns (2 allocs: 112 bytes)

julia> @b x rand # put the access in the setup phase (most concise in simple cases)
15.507 ns (2 allocs: 112 bytes)
```
